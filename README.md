## 📦 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run ResuFit locally on your machine:

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.13+** installed. If you plan on using the scanned OCR fallback, download and install [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and ensure it is added to your environment path.

### 2. Clone & Setup Environment
Open your shell in the project folder and create a virtual environment:
```powershell
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`:
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and configure the environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Example / Default Value | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `secret_key` | Flask session encryption key | `some_random_secret_string` | **Yes** |
| `groq_api_key` | Groq API Key for Llama 3 models | `gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` | **Yes** |
| `OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` | Bypass HTTPS constraint for local OAuth testing | `1` | **Yes** (locally) |
| `EMAIL_USER` | Gmail address for sending verification OTPs | `your_email@gmail.com` | No (fallback works) |
| `EMAIL_PASS` | Gmail App Password for SMTP authentication | `abcd efgh ijkl mnop` | No (fallback works) |
| `client_id` | Google OAuth Client ID | `xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com` | No (local login works) |
| `client_secret` | Google OAuth Client Secret | `GOCSPX-xxxxxxxxxxxxx` | No (local login works) |
| `redirect_uri` | Google OAuth Redirect URI | `http://localhost:5000/callback` | No (local login works) |

Example `.env` configuration:
```env
secret_key = YourFlaskSecretKey
groq_api_key = YourGroqApiKeyHere
OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT = 1
```

### 5. Launch the Server
Start the Flask application:
```powershell
python app.py
```
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## 📖 How to Use Guide

1. **Scan Your Current Resume**: Click "Choose File" on the Landing Page simulator or click "Sign In" (credentials: `test@example.com` / `Password123!`) to open the main **Dashboard**. Upload a PDF to view your ATS score, strengths, and suggestions.
2. **Scan Job Description Gaps**: Navigate to the **Job Fit Analysis** tab, paste the target job description, select your resume file, and click "Submit". Review missing keywords and recommendations.
3. **Build from Scratch**: Go to the **Resume Builder** tab and click "Create New Resume". Use the step-by-step wizard on the left. Watch the A4 template preview on the right update dynamically as you type.
4. **Tailor to Job Description**: In the builder finish tab, paste a job description into the tailoring input box and click "Tailor Resume". The AI will rewrite achievements and descriptions directly in the live A4 preview.
5. **Cycle Templates**: Use the layout selector sidebar to cycle between Templates 1 to 8 to find the visual format that fits your industry.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture & Details

### 🗄️ Database Schema (SQLite)

The application stores user credentials and uploads metadata in a local SQLite file (`database.db`) consisting of two main tables:

1. **`users` Table**:
   * `id`: `INTEGER` (Primary Key Auto-Increment)
   * `email`: `TEXT` (Unique, Not Null)
   * `password`: `TEXT` (Hashed password using Werkzeug)
   * `provider`: `TEXT` (Authentication source: `signup` or `google`)

2. **`uploads` Table**:
   * `id`: `INTEGER` (Primary Key Auto-Increment)
   * `file_path`: `TEXT` (Local path of the uploaded resume PDF)
   * `uploaded_at`: `TIMESTAMP` (Upload timestamp, defaults to current time)

---

### 🌐 Key Backend API Endpoints (Flask)

* `GET /`: Renders the landing page with user statistics.
* `POST /signin` / `POST /signup`: Authenticates users and registers new accounts.
* `GET /home`: Renders the user dashboard interface (authorized only).
* `POST /upload`: Handles PDF upload, triggers OCR/PyMuPDF text extraction, calls Groq AI grading, and returns parsed resume insights in JSON.
* `POST /analyze_job`: Takes the uploaded resume text and a job description, performs Gap Analysis, and returns matched/missing keywords and certifications.
* `GET /builder`: Renders the multi-template builder wizard.
* `POST /optimize`: Interface to Groq AI that takes resume content and job specifications, performing real-time summary/experience tailoring.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### 1. Tesseract OCR Path Error
If you upload scanned PDFs or images and get an error saying `tesseract is not installed or not in your path`:
* **Windows**: Download the installer from UB-Mannheim's Tesseract distribution and install it. Add the path (usually `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`) to your System Environment variables under `Path` and restart your shell/VS Code.
* **Mac/Linux**: Install it using `brew install tesseract` or `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`.

### 2. Groq API Rate Limits or API Key Errors
If you receive standard HTTP 401/429 errors from Groq:
* Double-check your API key inside `.env` to verify it begins with `gsk_`.
* Ensure you have query credits remaining on your Groq console.

### 3. Database Locks (`sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`)
If SQLite locks when starting the server or recording tests:
* Kill any active background Flask processes by running:
  ```powershell
  Stop-Process -Name python -Force
  ```
